intro: |
  I am interested in the interfaces between evolutionary ecology, biodiversity- ecosystem functioning and restoration ecology. My current research focuses on the relative contribution of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity to ecosystem function and services. I have great interest in the mechanisms shaping plant communities and theory-driven ecological restoration. I am also very interested in broader scales, phylogenetic comparative methods, macroevolutionary patterns and the evolution of plant sex. Scientific coordinator of the tree diversity experiment EFForTS-BEE. Ambassador of the Center for Open Science.
