## Summary

I am interested in the interfaces between evolutionary ecology, biodiversity- ecosystem functioning and restoration ecology.

-   My current research focuses on the relative contribution of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity to ecosystem function and services.
-   I have great interest in the mechanisms shaping plant communities and theory-driven ecological restoration.
-   I am also very interested in broader scales, phylogenetic comparative methods, macroevolutionary patterns and the evolution of plant sex.
-   Scientific coordinator of the tree diversity experiment EFForTS-BEE.
-   Ambassador of the Center for Open Science.
