### Global Restore Project (GRP)

A database of ecological restoration projects around the world.

**Status:** `ongoing`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary

The Global Restore Project is a database of ecological restoration
projects around the world. Our vision for this project is long-term. We
are focused on collecting species-level community vegetation monitoring
data right now. In other words, we are interested in studies where folks
monitored all the species that occured in their monitoring samples. We
are gathering, and harmonising these data, and we plan to make them
open-acess as soon as we are able.
