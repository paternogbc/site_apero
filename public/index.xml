      <description>EFForTS-BEE     Biodiversity enrichment in oil palm plantations: plant succession and integration (EFForTS-BEE)
Status: ongoing
 Summary     The transformation of rainforests into oil palm plantations leads to dramatic losses in biodiversity and in ecological functioning. In order to test possibilities for alleviation, we established a biodiversity enrichment experiment by planting tree islands in an oil palm landscape, systematically varying plot size and species number.</description>

      <description>Global Restore Project (GRP)     A database of ecological restoration projects around the world.
Status: ongoing
 Summary     The Global Restore Project is a database of ecological restoration projects around the world. Our vision for this project is long-term. We are focused on collecting species-level community vegetation monitoring data right now. In other words, we are interested in studies where folks monitored all the species that occured in their monitoring samples.</description>

      <title>Key concepts and a world-wide look at plant recruitment networks</title>

      <description>Abstract     Plant‚Äìplant interactions are major determinants of the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. There is a long tradition in the study of these interactions, their mechanisms and their consequences using experimental, observational and theoretical approaches. Empirical studies overwhelmingly focus at the level of species pairs or small sets of species. Although empirical data on these interactions at the community level are scarce, such studies have gained pace in the last decade.</description>

      <title>The Phylogenetic Architecture of Recruitment Networks</title>
      <link>https://gustavopaterno.com/publication/2025-gleiser/</link>

      <description>Abstract     Plant recruitment involves both stochastic and deterministic processes. Recruits may establish independently or interact nonrandomly with canopy plants. We explore this deterministic aspect by testing whether recruitment patterns are influenced by the phylogenetic history of canopy and recruiting plants. Since the effect of canopy plants in recruitment can be positive (facilitation), negative (competition) or neutral, we also estimated the phylogenetic signal separately for each interaction type.</description>

      <description>Abstract     In monoculture-dominated landscapes, recovering biodiversity is a priority, but effective restoration strategies have yet to be identified. In this study, we experimentally tested passive and active restoration strategies to recover taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of woody plants within 52 tree islands established in an oil palm landscape. Large tree islands and higher initial planted diversity catalyzed diversity recovery, particularly functional diversity at the landscape level.</description>

      <title>Combining planting trees and natural regeneration promotes long-term structural complexity in oil palm landscapes</title>

      <description>Abstract     Vegetation structural complexity has been identified as a vital factor for forest ecosystem function, stability, and resilience. However, agricultural land with much reduced structural complexity has largely replaced natural forests in the tropics. Therefore, restoring structural complexity in large-scale plantation monocultures by introducing agroforestry systems may counteract the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, we still have limited knowledge of how the structural complexity of agroforests develops under different restoration treatments.</description>

      <title>Tree diversity reduces variability in sapling survival under drought</title>

      <description>Abstract     Enhancing tree diversity may be important to fostering resilience to drought-related climate extremes. So far, little attention has been given to whether tree diversity can increase the survival of trees and reduce its variability in young forest plantations. We conducted an analysis of seedling and sapling survival from 34 globally distributed tree diversity experiments (363,167 trees, 168 species, 3744 plots, 7 biomes) to answer two questions: (1) Do drought and tree diversity alter the mean and variability in plot-level tree survival, with higher and less variable survival as diversity increases?</description>
