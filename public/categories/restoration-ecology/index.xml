      <description>EFForTS-BEE     Biodiversity enrichment in oil palm plantations: plant succession and integration (EFForTS-BEE)
Status: ongoing

In order to test possibilities for alleviation, we established a biodiversity enrichment experiment by planting tree islands in an oil palm landscape, systematically varying plot size and species number.</description>

      <description>Global Restore Project (GRP)     A database of ecological restoration projects around the world.
Status: ongoing
 Summary     The Global Restore Project is a database of ecological restoration projects around the world. Our vision for this project is long-term.

In other words, we are interested in studies where folks monitored all the species that occured in their monitoring samples.</description>
